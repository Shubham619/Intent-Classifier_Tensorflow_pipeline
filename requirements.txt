- so the it team did get back to me and they told me that because you meet the criteria the specialization was automatically renewed ” i understand but still we’re comming back to the question w ch program agreement we’ve accepted states that the specialization is automatically renewed if we meet the program specialization criteria it looks like the channel program incentive agreement program rules applies here but it would be surprising as the program was created to apply to the incentive programs not the specializations certification at all let’s face the possible scenario atende’s gold certification anniversary date is may th each year the next gold certification audit is about to be performed during the gold renewal process in according to the channel program audit policies the status for that certification changes from “approved” to recert mode days prior to the anniversary date the recertification window will be open just after it it means that as long as atende will be eligible in terms of gold certification rules that certification can be autoreenrolled in the begining of february that scenario could potentially put us in very inconvenient position don’t you t nk why because the very same channel program audit policies document states that partner can submit their certification recertification application anytime during that renewal period but no later than days after the anniversary date so we have a right to reenroll the gold renewal application even in the beginning of june but if the channel program incentive agreement program rules aply here if the system recognises that atende is eligible in terms of gold certification it will be autoreenrolled in begining of february as the consequence the recertification audit procedure will start a few months earlier that we may potentially want to lachezar do you see my point that scenario is very dangerous and may cause lots of problems that is why we have to clarify that situation we have discussed that case with janusz motoszko our partner manager he was surprised just like us that the channel program incentive agreement program applies not just to the incentive programs but also to the specializations certification could you pls investigate it and come back to us with the explanation needed looking forward to hearing from you soon many thanks .
